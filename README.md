# Moonbeam Truffle Plugin

This is meant to be used with the Moonbeam Truffle box: https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam-truffle-box.git

You can run any of the commands below from within the Moonbeam Truffle Box repo.

The plugin is used to get you started with a local development Moonbeam node quickly. You can check all available commands with the help flag:

```
./node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam help
```

The following commands are available:

## Install

In this context, installing means downloading the Docker image of the Moonbeam development node (requires Docker to be installed).

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam install
```

## Start

Start the development Moonbeam node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam start
```

The start command comes with custom options:
- `--ws-port`: For setting a custom unified HTTP and WS port. Accepts a port number to the right of the command.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam start --ws-port 8545
```

## Stop

Stop the development Moonbeam node. This will remove the container, thus purging the chain.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam stop
```

## Pause

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam pause
```

## Unpause
